**Recent Achievements:**


- Our paper "On the Resilience of Biometric Authentication Systems against Random Inputs" has been accepted to <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NDSS 2020</a>.

- Our paper “A Decade of Mal-Activity Reporting: A Retrospective Analysis of Internet Malicious Activity Blacklists”, received the <strong>Best Paper Award</strong> at <strong>AsiaCCS</strong> 2019.

- Our paper ""<strong>The Value of Collaboration in Convex Machine Learning with Differential Privacy</strong>" is accepted in <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>IEEE Security &amp; Privacy (Oakland) 2020</strong>.</a>

The paper develops differentially private gradient descent algorithms for training Machine learning models on distributed private datasets owned by different entities. We prove that the quality of the trained ML model using DP gradient descent algorithm scales inversely with privacy budgets squared, and the size of the distributed datasets squared, which establishes a trade-off between privacy and utility in privacy-preserving ML;

We also develop a theory that enables to predict the outcome of a potential collaboration among privacy-aware data owners (or data custodians) in terms of the fitness cost of the ML training model prior to executing potentially computationally-expensive ML algorithms on distributed privately-owned datasets.
