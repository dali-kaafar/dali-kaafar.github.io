I am (Full) Professor at the [Faculty of Science and Engineering](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/faculty-of-science-and-engineering), [MQ school of Computing](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/faculties-and-departments/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-centres/department-of-computing) at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.

I am the Executive Director of [The Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub](https://www.mq.edu.au/partner/access-business-opportunities/innovation-entrepreneurship-and-it/cyber-security-hub) and director of the Data Security and Privacy R&D Program.

With [a team of collaborators](https://dali-kaafar.github.io/collaborations/) I am interested in the broad R&D activities in Cyber Security in Emerging Technologies with a vision to enable Explicit Trust in the Digital Economy. My primary research interests are Data Security and Privacy, with a focus on Privacy-Preserving (or Enhancing) technologies and Information Security for Web and Mobile applications, (Provably) private date sharing and Trustworthy Secure and Private Machine learning techniques.

Prior to joining Macquarie University, I was group leader (and founder) of the Information Security and Privacy group at CSIRO Data61, a principal researcher at National ICT Australia (NICTA) and a permament researcher at the Privatics team at INRIA in France.


**[I am always looking to hire highly motivated and outstanding PhDs for postdoctoral fellows positions and undergraduates students for Phd/MRes scholarships.]

We very often have open positions and scholarships available, even though sometimes backlogged for advertisements, so do not hesitate to reach out.
